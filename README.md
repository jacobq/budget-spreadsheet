# budget-spreadsheet
Excel-based monthly spending planner

## Introduction
When my wife and I took Dave Ramsey's "Financial Peace University" course in late 2012 we created this spreadsheet to plan and track our spending.
I think it is a good compromise between a full-blown accounting system (I had been using (GnuCash)(http://www.gnucash.org/) for years)
and pencil and paper (if you do this by hand, props to you for your patience and organization!).
DISCLAIMER: Although it works great for my purposes, I'm an engineer and enjoy numbers, spreadsheets, formulas, source code, etc.
If you're not comfortable working with an Excel spreadsheet and aren't interested in learning how it works, I recommend using a budgeting app like (EveryDollar)(https://www.everydollar.com/) instead. They're designed to be hard / impossible to mess up whereas you can tinker to your heart's content with this one, and as a consequence of that it is possible to get incorrect results, errors, etc.

## How it works
Before we dive in, I want to define some terms that I'll be using:

- *account*: something that can contain money/debt (e.g. checking account, wallet / envelopes, mortgage, credit card, etc.)
- *income*: money coming into an account
- *transfer*: money moving from one account to another
- *expense*: money leaving an account

In order to use this spreadsheet you'll have to decide what accounts you want to track with it and how you'd like to categorize your spending.

...

This spreadsheet is based around the idea of a (Zero-Based Budget)(http://www.daveramsey.com/blog/zero-based-budget-what-why)
(Note that this term also has another meaning, see (Wikipedia)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_budgeting), but that's not what I'm talking about).
That is, the total amount of income must match the total amount of expenses in order for it to work.
